We have put together a demo to showcase an example use case of how different Tapis services can be used. We will first look at the demo overview.

[Demo Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4L3AtBG2BHscKgVhcHfWKAiSBlyB8J3yU86PT99Cgc/edit?usp=sharing)

The git repo for demo can be found here [Tapis Jupyter](https://github.com/tapis-project/tapis-juptyer)

Note: Attendees are welcome to read the contents of [ipython notebook](https://github.com/tapis-project/tapis-juptyer/blob/master/tapis_notebook.ipynb) however, they will not be able to run it yet for their TACC user ids.
