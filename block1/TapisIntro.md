## The Tapis project
Tapis is an open source, NSF funded Application Program Interface (API) platform for distributed computation that will provide production-grade capabilities to enable researchers

* Securely execute workflows that span geographicallydistributed providers </br>
* Store and retrieve streaming/sensor data for real-time and batch job processing, with support fortemporal and spatial  indexes and queries </br>
* Leverage containerized codes to enable portability, and reduce the overall time-to-solution by utilizing data locality and other “smart scheduling” techniques </br>
* Improve repeatability and reproducibilityof computations with history and provenance tracking built into the API </br>
* Manage access to data and results througha fine-grained permissions model, so that digital assets can be securely shared  with colleagues or the community at large.
