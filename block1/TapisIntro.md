## The Tapis project
Tapis is an open source, NSF funded Application Program Interface (API) platform for distributed computation that will provide production-grade capabilities to enable researchers to 1) securely execute workflows that span geographicallydistributed providers, 2) store and retrieve streaming/sensor data for real-time and batch job processing, with support fortemporal and spatial indexes and queries, 3) leverage containerized codes to enable portability, and reduce the overall time-to-solution by utilizing data locality and other “smart scheduling” techniques, 4) improve repeatability and reproducibilityof computations with history and provenance tracking built into the API, and 5) manage access to data and results througha fine-grained permissions model, so that digital assets can be securely shared with colleagues or the community at large.
